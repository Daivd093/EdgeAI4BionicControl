# EdgeAI4BionicControl
Implementation of  tinyML in STM32 to test the feasibility of controlling a bionic prosthesis using brain signals.
## Datasets_and_Models
This folder contains the code of the neural networks that are used to detect the finger flexion.
## STM32_HelloWorld
This folder contains the STM32 project Hello World to test the capabilities of the hardware, as well as those of STM32Cube.AI
## STM32_FingerFlexion
This folder contains the final STM32 project that implements the FingerFlexionEstimating NeuralNerworks into a Nucleo64 L476RG.
## HelloWorld_Models
This folder contains the code of the neural networks that are used for the HelloWorld Project
